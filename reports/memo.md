Summary of the business problem:

Anyone looking to buy or sell a house is likely curious as to what factors really influence the price of a home they are looking to purchase or list for sale. Real estate investors who look to ‘flip’ houses after remodels are likely also curious as to what factors would allow them to maximize their sale price and thus increasing their profit margin on the house. Typically, people have relied on real estate experts to guide their home improvement projects. What if now there is evidence of certain home features actually impacting the price of a house?

Our group (Jarod, Sam and Calvin) is trying to build a predictive model to correlate certain features to the sale price of a home. These features can include a fairly wide range of factors including, but not limited to, the following:
    
- Physical characteristics of the home building itself (square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, etc)
- Information about the land which the home is built (property lot size, waterfront (or not), historic site)
- General location (city, zip code, topography of the land (flat, mountains, valley), etc)
- Hazards or nuisances nearby (steep slopes for landslides, power lines, heavy traffic roads, airport noise)

Ideally, this would allow for a more concrete and quantitative reason for certain homes to cost more than others as well as proof that certain home features are more worth including in a home renovation than others.

Key takeaways from our solution:

Stakeholders should care about what we found because, we now have a working base model to use as a tool to guide and provide insight - regarding the correlation of home prices and specific home features. Our group’s findings can help home buyers, sellers, real estate investors and home builders. Certain home features are highly sought after in today’s real estate climate but not everything necessarily correlates to higher home prices. For example, our group found that the top 4 individual factors of home price are: Building grade, square footage, quality of view and whether or not there was a waterfront (or not) on the property.

These four factors are interesting because it seems that the most important factors of a home and sale price are things like 'curb appeal' or an open layout floor plan with a nice big kitchen that has an island for cooking and eating as well. Factors like square footage and view or waterfront are not that surprising though.

Interestingly enough, we found that the nuisances of power lines on property as well as traffic noise had negligible amounts of impact on the sale price of a home. However, when we take into consideration the reality of the current housing market in the greater Seattle area - this makes sense since people are eager to buy and invest in the area regardless.

Next steps:

The next steps our team would take, given more time, would be to focus on data engineering with the data given. We would also try to incorporate additional sources of data so that we could have more variables to try and correlate to home sale prices. Factors like a 'walk-score' or crime rate in certain cities would probably be useful and is definitely something that current home buyers and sellers try to account for. Additional data engineering would include finding better representations of certain categorical data from the original data set so that the correlation found between those features and sale price would have more significant meaning.
